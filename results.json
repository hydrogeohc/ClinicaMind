      "transcript": "Hi doctor, how are you? So I'm having the very sharp pain on my left arm, the upper part on the front. And when did it start? This started about a week ago. I fell on my back actually, I didn't hit my arm, but a day later started feeling this very weird pain on my arm. Have you noticed that it comes and goes or is it continuous? It comes and goes. And with regards to pain, can you describe it more? Is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it throbbing? Is it dull? And sometimes stabbing. It kind of varies between those two. And any associated symptoms with that pain? I've had shortness of breath sometimes, I've noticed. Gotcha. And is that every time you feel the pain or just some other time? Some of the times, not every time. Okay. And with regards to pain overall, have you had any factors that make it better or anything that makes it worse? Sometimes I'll take like extra strength Tylenol and it kind of helps, but I haven't been given any pain medications yet. Okay. And what about moving it or exercise or specific positions? Does anything make it worse? When I'm laying down, it makes it worse, yeah. Raise your arm up. Okay. Turn your head. To which side? To the right. Okay. To the left. When I turn to the left, it hurts. Gotcha. Okay. Any weakness? No, no weakness at all. I checked the reflexes and they're symmetric. I check your strength and strength looks good. You don't have any weakness in the biceps and the triceps, the shoulder, the hand grip or the finger strength. Sensation seems to be intact when I touch everywhere. It's symmetric in both arms. Now let's talk treatment plan and diagnosis. At this point, I would say here's some high-dose ibuprofen. Let's try that for the next week, twice a day. See how you feel.",

      "transcript": "So now it's been a month and you're still feeling the pain. I think we should take a closer look to see what may be causing it. Let's do the nerve testing at this point. Great. So I was taking the Tylenol or the ibuprofen that you prescribed. It's still, I'm still getting the pain when I lay down and I'm not sure what's going on with me. I'm starting to get worried. No weakness, so we'll take a closer look and see what's going on as far as what may be causing the symptoms. I suspect it to be pinched nerves, but we'll take a look. Oh, okay, great. So what is this test? It's called an EMG. It's an electromyography and nerve conduction velocity testing. Looks to see if the nerves are getting pinched, what may, what spot may be getting pinched or hurt or injured. Oh, that's interesting. I can see it here on the tablet. So this is basically the, what my, it's gonna measure the nerve activity? Is that what the little signals are that I see on the screen? Yeah, so we're gonna start, the first half of the test involves us putting a little electric current and following the current from the nerve all the way to the spinal cord and back. And that measuring of that will tell us what may or may not be going on with the nerves. Great, great. Okay, so then is it gonna hurt? It's a little uncomfortable. It's almost like very quick, such as a rubber band being snapped against the skin. Okay, I can handle that. Second half of the test, I'll insert a needle, almost like acupuncture, into a few spots in the muscles to measure the signal. And that will give us an idea of what may be going on with the nerves that address those muscles. Got it. One quick question. So I am on some medication, Prozac. Is that, does that affect any of this? No, it's totally fine. The only thing we worry about is if you were on blood thinners, sometimes you can get a little excess bleeding from the needle insertion. Oh yeah, I'm not taking any aspirin or anything like that. Great. Perfect. Then you should be fine.",
